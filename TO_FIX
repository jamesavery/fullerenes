This is a list of open bugs and similar kinds of misbehaviour.  This is not a list of feature requests or plans.

----------------------

* Need to homogenize layout2d - make sure that it exists whenever it's needed
  ** there appears to be some undefined behaviour with respect to layouts.
apps/hog-to-rspi works in my (lnw) laptop but segfaults on desktop because
there is no layout2d in 'find_outer_face' and the assertion fails.
* .CC1 crashes in fortran - use C++ file writing routine; implement cc1
* Make orientation the same for buckygen-generated fullerenes and spiral-generated.
  tutte_layout randomly chooses orientation.
* some jobs/routines (e474f1c1a5d261; input/CCc28.inp) fail because of missing
  layouts.  either put in some 'ifnot exists layout; create layout' whenever
  layouts are used (in the lib) or use the lib such that it doesn't fail.  I (lnw)
  think the first approach is better, a lib should be written such that it is
  hard to use wrongly.
* general spiral is broken since 917d49d2b4.  maybe not all of that stuff was unnecessary ... (lnw)
* inertial frame returns 'nan' in case of C60
* minimum empty sphere problem, algorithm fails too often

* Tutte-embedding fails:
** input/RSPInano.failed
** input/RSPInanofailed2.inp

* [FIXED] IsomerDB class can no longer read database text-format, only binary.

* Direct sparse linear solver fails for fulleroid example. Why?
