This is a list of open bugs and similar kinds of misbehaviour.  This is not a list of feature requests or plans.

----------------------

* Problem with opt-standalone
* C60 is no longer spherical
* Need to homogenize layout2d - make sure that it exists whenever it's needed
* .CC1 crashes in fortran - use C++ file writing routine; implement cc1
* Make orientation the same for buckygen-generated fullerenes and spiral-generated.
  tutte_layout randomly chooses orientation.
