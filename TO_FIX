This is a list of open bugs and similar kinds of misbehaviour.  This is not a list of feature requests or plans.

----------------------

* Problem with opt-standalone
* C60 is no longer spherical
* Need to homogenize layout2d - make sure that it exists whenever it's needed
* .CC1 crashes in fortran - use C++ file writing routine; implement cc1
* Make orientation the same for buckygen-generated fullerenes and spiral-generated.
  tutte_layout randomly chooses orientation.
* some jobs/routines (e474f1c1a5d261; input/CCc28.inp) fail because of missing
  layouts.  either put in some 'ifnot exists layout; create layout' whenever
  layouts are used (in the lib) or use the lib such that it doesn't fail.  I (lnw)
  think the first approach is better, a lib should be written such that it is
  hard to use wrongly.
----------------------

there is something wrong about opt-standalone: find and fix (lnw)

----------------------

general spiral is broken since 917d49d2b4.  maybe not all of that stuff was unnecessary ... (lnw)
