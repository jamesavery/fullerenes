!          A PROGRAM FOR TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF FULLERENES
!    The program creates cartesian coordinates for fullerenes isomers
!        and performs a topological/graph theoretical analysis.
!        The results can be used for plotting fullerene graphs
!     (Schlegel diagrams) and structures, and as a starting point
!            for further quantum theoretical treatment.

!* The program is LINUX/UNIX based and works fine with gfortran and 
!      gc compilers
!    You need to use the Makefile included in fullerene.zip. Simply type make. 
!    The executable "fullerene" runs on a mac intel as:
!      ./fullerene <inp >out
!    If you type      make tests      it runs all the input jobs and
!      puts them into *.out
!    If you type      make clean      all the object files are deleted
!    If you type      make distclean  all the object files are deleted + more
!    It currently compiles in a 64 bit version, but you can change to
!      32 bits in the Makefile if necessary
!    All fortran files are in the directory    source
!    All C-files are in the directory          libgraph

! A database is provided for general isomers up tp C100 and for IPR isomers up to
! C120 including the number of Hamiltonian cycles. The database can be copied into
! the main program folder and can be used to read the ring spiral pentagon indices.
! The numbering scheme is exactly that chosen in the book by Fowler and Manopoulus
! (ref.2), that is each isomer in the books appendix can be constructed easily
! from the database. 
! Note: the directory database needs to be in the main directory where source or 
! libgraph is.
