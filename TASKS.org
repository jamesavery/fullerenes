* DEVELOPMENT

3. 3D structure numerically via distorted icosahedron, subsequent tiling

1. GUI
   decide functionality
   design properly

2. 2d optimizer in cpp, acting on the layout, member of PlanarGraph (lukas)
   -- fancy extension: choose outer face such that layout get maximal symmetry

4. symmetry ...
   calulate equivalence classes under symmetry group of triangulation via brinkmann (james)
   identify pointgroup (harder than expected)
   Brinkmann's graph enumeration
   1. Orientation -> strings -> lex. smallest string starting at node with deg != 6. Easy.
   2. Following that: Symmetry classification. (Lots of work but useful for doing general cubic)



* WRITING

5. GS Paper
   2. James: Write up pretty pseudocode for both operations general spiral <-> graph.
   3. Lukas+James: Examples - run and describe, possible output stuff from program for figures.
   4. James: Write introduction,conclusion to GS paper.

6. Review ...



* LATER

7. direct3d
