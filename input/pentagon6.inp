C1350 Leap frog from C50
For this case the molecule is preoptimized after the
Tutte embedding with the Wu FF plus an additional
repulsive potentialvspecified by fcoulomb and then
optimized with the normal force field. If pre-
optimization is not done, the structure is not
good and heavily distorted
