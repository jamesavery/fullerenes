D5d-840 Nanotube. I could not locate eigenvectors for FM, using Tutte instead from ring spiral indices
This is also an example where one has to play with the scaleRad parameter to get a good structure.
This example also shows that more progress needs to made in getting good initial structures
If scaleRad=6.9 does not work use scaleRad=7.0
