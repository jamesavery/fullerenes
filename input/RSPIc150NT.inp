D5h-C150 Leap frog from D5h-C50 nanotube through ring spiral indices
For this case the molecule is preoptimised after the Tutte embedding with the Wu FF plus an additional
repulsive potential specified by fcoulomb and then optimised with the normal force field. 
If preoptimization is not done, the structure is not good and heavily distorted.
