D5h-C1350 Leap frog from D5h-C50 nanotube through ring spiral indices
For this case the molecule is preoptimized after the
Tutte embedding with the Wu FF plus an additional
repulsive potential specified by fcoulomb and then
optimized with the normal force field. If pre-
optimization is not done, the structure is not
good and heavily distorted
